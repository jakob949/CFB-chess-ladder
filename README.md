# The Chess Ladder System

Welcome to the Chess Ladder Ranking System for the Chess Club at the Center For Biosustainability at DTU! This project aims to manage and display rankings for members participating in chess activities.
The rankings on the ladder are calculated using the ELO rating system, providing a relative ranking of players. For details on the ELO rating system, refer to [Elo Rating System on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). The implementation follows the approach detailed in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ddm7018/Elo)
